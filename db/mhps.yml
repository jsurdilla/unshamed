  about_me:
    <p>
      I trained at the Institute for the Psychology of Eating, the world’s leading school in Nutritional Psychology 
      where I received my certification as an Eating Psychology Coach. In IPE's internationally acclaimed 
      program, I learned powerful cutting-edge tools and protocols that enable me to work with weight issues, 
      body image challenges, overeating, binge eating, and a variety of nutrition related health concerns such 
      as digestion, fatigue, mood, immunity, and others. My work combines the powerful new fields of Dynamic 
      Eating Psychology and Mind-Body Nutrition. The skills I use from this training are a combination of 
      practical coaching techniques, results-oriented psychology, clinical nutrition, body-centered practices, 
      mind-body science, and a positive and compassionate approach to challenges with food and health.

  about_me:
    <p>
      Michelle is a graduate of Adelphi University where she received her Master of Social Work Degree. 
      Upon graduation she was eager to begin her journey in helping others learn to help themselves. 
      A firm believer in the saying, "Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish
      and he can feed himself for the rest of his life.", Michelle helps others by educating, empowering,
      and encouraging them to gain greater feelings of self-worth and self-confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Michelle is the mother of three children.  Her middle child was diagnosed with Autism over 15 years ago.
      It is through her receiving parental training for children with disabilities coupled with her education,
      that she has become an advocate for parents of children with special needs. Her work with Parent To Parent,
      a national organization, as a volunteer support parent as well as her workshops and seminars in schools 
      across Long Island, New York has connected her with a very special population that often goes under served.
      Children with special needs receive services, but what about the parents, as well as the educators of these
      special children.  More often than not, they need assistance as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Michelle emphasizes Self-Care as being a main ingredient in helping others through helping yourself.
      Learning how to do this promises a wonderful journey. Please take that journey today.

  about_me:
    <p>
      I began my career working in the Bronx with teens afflicted with HIV and AIDS.
      This experience solidified my love and truth for working with teens, young adults,
      and their families. The ability to be invited into someone's private world
      and be witness to what they experience is a privilege. As therapists,
      we learn how they move through their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may sense that things have happened to them that make them feel shame, anger,
      hurt and just plain unlovable. Maybe the message they hear is that, they are not good enough,
      pretty enough or smart enough. Many teens may feel like they have to pretend to be 
      someone else to fit in and make others like them. The core of my work is helping them
      get out of that familiar feeling of being stuck, unhappy and exhausted. My core belief
      is that no one is broken. Together we will look at patterns in behavior that can tell us 
      what can be different. By learning to understand those areas that keep them feeling stuck 
      and small, we can immediately stop some anxiety. There is a lot of deep information 
      in this work. Please remember, the best YOU is not born, it is created!!

    <p>
      Rivka Edery, M.S.W., L.C.S.W. has a Bachelor’s of Arts in Social Science and a Masters in Social Work from Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service.  She is a highly intuitive and sensitive psychotherapist, with a private practice in Brooklyn, NY, and is a first time author specializing in trauma recovery and spirituality.  She has been active in the treatment and recovery field for more than eighteen years.  Since 2009, she has been working as a clinical social worker assisting clients who are recovering from trauma-related disorders.  She has treated numerous clients and has talked with hundreds of recovering addicts.  As her career was advancing, Rivka wondered if the ancient spiritual principles of the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous can be applied to the healing of trauma.  One day, she was suddenly inspired with an idea that had a firm hold on her and has not let go since.  It combined the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous that saved her life, with life problems that are a result of surviving traumatic experiences.  The result is a unique approach for trauma survivors who are seeking a combined spiritual and clinical approach to their personal effects of surviving trauma.

    </p>
    <p>
      The focus of this radio show series is to discuss my book: "Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide".
      We discuss how the survivor can accomplish the following in their trauma healing:  Achieve safety, 
      reduce their troublesome symptoms, increasing their competencies, review and reappraise their
       trauma memories, consolidate their gains by learning and applying new behavioral, emotional, 
       physical and spiritual skills.  The focus is a very positive one encouraging listeners to adapt 
       a more loving, compassionate understanding of themselves and their trauma memories.  Included in 
       this, is supporting the listeners to seek professional and informal support systems, and if it 
       is required to create a personal care plan.
