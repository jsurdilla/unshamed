    <p>
      Rivka Edery, M.S.W., L.C.S.W. has a Bachelor’s of Arts in Social Science and a Masters in Social Work from Fordham University
      Graduate School of Social Service.  She is a highly intuitive and sensitive psychotherapist, with a private practice in
      Brooklyn, NY, and is a first time author specializing in trauma recovery and spirituality.  She has been active in the treatment
      and recovery field for more than eighteen years.  Since 2009, she has been working as a clinical social worker assisting clients
      who are recovering from trauma-related disorders.  She has treated numerous clients and has talked with hundreds of recovering addicts.
      As her career was advancing, Rivka wondered if the ancient spiritual principles of the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous can be
      applied to the healing of trauma.  One day, she was suddenly inspired with an idea that had a firm hold on her and has not let go since.
      It combined the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous that saved her life, with life problems that are a result of surviving traumatic
      experiences.  The result is a unique approach for trauma survivors who are seeking a combined spiritual and clinical approach to their
      personal effects of surviving trauma.

    <p>
      I began my career working in the Bronx with teens afflicted with HIV and AIDS. This experience solidified my love and truth for
      working with teens, young adults and their families. The ability to be invited into someone's private world and be witness to what they
      experience is a privilege. As therapist, we learn how they move through their life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We may sense that things have happened to them that 
      make them feel shame, anger, hurt and just plain unlovable. Maybe the message they hear is that, they are not good enough, pretty enough
      or smart enough. Many teens may feel like they have to pretend to be someone else to fit in and make others like them. The core of my work
      is helping them get out of that familiar feeling of being stuck, unhappy and exhausted. My core belief is that no one is broken. Together
      we will look at patterns in behavior that can tell us what can be different. By learning to understand those areas that keep them
      feeling stuck and small, we can immediately stop some anxiety. There is a lot of deep information in this work. Please remember, the best
      YOU is not born, it is created!!
